This model implements and evaluates multiple machine learning algorithms for breast cancer prediction, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Linear Regression. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, performance assessment through key metrics, and visualization using confusion matrices and prediction comparisons. Additionally, it incorporates a recommendation system to classify new patient data as either "Malignant" (indicative of cancer) or "Benign" (non-cancerous), offering a comprehensive approach for breast cancer diagnosis .
